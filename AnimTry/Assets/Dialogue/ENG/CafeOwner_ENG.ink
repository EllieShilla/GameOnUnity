Hello, employee of the month!
*[Best because the only one?]
[CafeOwner]
But what about me? 
[MainCharacter]
You are the owner, so it doesn't count.
*[Hello!]
[CafeOwner]
Came to work?
**[_FIGHT_ Yes. (Fight)]
[CafeOwner]
That's the spirit!
**[Some other time.]
[CafeOwner]
Good. But remember, hard work makes you better. And the work is paid.
