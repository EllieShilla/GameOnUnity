Hello, Pancake Man!
[MainCharacter]
No insults, please. I'm a Waffle Man.
[Bobby]
As you say. By the way, would you like to work in the kitchen?
[MainCharacter]
Are you kidding me? Mr. Brody will have my head!
[Bobby]
My dad is not that evil. Plus, he likes the food you serve in the cafe.
[Bobby]
But don't tell him that.
[Bobby]
So how about work?
*[_FIGHT_ Fine. (Fight)]
[Bobby]
Great.
*[Some other time.]
[Bobby]
Whatever, man.
